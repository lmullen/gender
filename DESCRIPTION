Authors@R: c(person("Lincoln", "Mullen", role = c("aut", "cre"),
    email = "lincoln@lincolnmullen.com"),
    person("Cameron", "Blevins", role = "ctb"),
    person("Ben", "Schmidt", role = "ctb"))
Description: Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth using historical
    datasets. By using these datasets instead of lists of male and female names,
    this package is able to more accurately guess the gender of a name, and it
    is able to report the probability that a name was male or female.

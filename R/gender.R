#' Predict gender from first names using historical data
#'
#' This function predicts the gender of a first name given a year or range of
#' years in which the person was born. The prediction can use one of several
#' data sets suitable for different time periods or geographical regions. See
#' the package vignette for suggestions on using this function with multiple
#' names and for a discussion of which data set is most suitable for your
#' research question. When using certain methods, the \code{genderdata} data
#' package is required; you will be prompted to install it if it is not already
#' available.
#'
#' @param names First names as a character vector. Names are case insensitive.
#' @param years The birth year of the name whose gender is to be predicted. This
#'   argument can be either a single year, a range of years in the form
#'   \code{c(1880, 1900)}. If no value is specified, then for the \code{ "ssa"}
#'   method it will use the period 1932 to 2012; acceptable years for the SSA
#'   method range from 1880 to 2012, but for years before 1930 the IPUMS method
#'   is probably more accurate. For the \code{"ipums"} method the default range
#'   is the period 1789 to 1930, which is also the range of acceptable years.
#'   For the \code{"napp"} method the default range is the period 1758 to 1910,
#'   which is also the range of acceptable years. If a year or range of years is
#'   specified, then the names will be looked up for that period.
#' @param method This value determines the data set that is used to predict the
#'   gender of the name. The \code{"ssa"} method looks up names based from the
#'   U.S. Social Security Administration baby name data. (This method is based
#'   on an implementation by Cameron Blevins.) The \code{"ipums"} method looks
#'   up names from the U.S. Census data in the Integrated Public Use Microdata
#'   Series. (This method was contributed by Ben Schmidt.) The \code{"napp"}
#'   method uses census microdata from Canada, Great Britain, Denmark,
#'   Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1801 to 1910 created by the
#'   \href{https://www.nappdata.org/napp/}{North Atlantic Population Project}.
#'   The
#'   \code{"kantrowitz"} method uses the Kantrowitz corpus of male and female
#'   names. \code{"ind"} method uses the Indian corpus of male and female
#'   names.The \code{"genderize"} method uses the Genderize.io
#'   <\url{http://genderize.io/}> API, which is based on "user profiles across
#'   major social networks." The \code{"demo"} method is uses the top 100 names
#'   in the SSA method; it is provided only for demonstration purposes when the
#'   \code{genderdata} package is not installed and it is not suitable for
#'   research purposes.
#' @param countries The countries for which datasets are being used. For the
#'   \code{"ssa"} and \code{"ipums"} methods, the only valid option is
#'   \code{"United States"} which will be assumed if no argument is specified.
#'   For the \code{"napp"} method, you may specify a character vector with any
#'   of the following countries: \code{"Canada"}, \code{"United Kingdom"},
#'   \code{"Denmark"}, \code{"Iceland"}, \code{"Norway"}, \code{"Sweden"}. For
#'   the \code{"kantrowitz"} and \code{"genderize"} methods, no country should
#'   be specified.
#' @return Returns a data frame containing the results of predicting the gender.
#'   The exact components of the returned list will depend on the specific
#'   method used. They include the following: \item{name}{The name for which the
#'   gender has been predicted.} \item{proportion_male}{The proportion of male
#'   names for the given range of years.} \item{proportion_female}{The
#'   proportion of female names for the given range of years.} \item{gender}{The
#'   predicted gender based on the proportion of male and female names. Possible
#'   values are \code{"male"} and \code{"female"} for proportions above
#'   \code{0.5}, \code{"either"} for proportions that are exactly \code{0.5},
#'   and \code{NA} for combinations of names and years for which a gender cannot
#'   be predicted using the given method.} \item{year_min}{The lower bound
#'   (inclusive) of the year range used for the prediction.} \item{year_max}{The
#'   upper bound (inclusive) of the year range used for the prediction.}
